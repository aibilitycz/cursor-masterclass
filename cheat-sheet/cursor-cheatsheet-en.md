## 🎯 Pro Tips

### Effective Prompting
1. **Be specific** - instead of "write something" use "write 200-word LinkedIn post"
2. **Provide context** - who you are, who you're writing for, what's the purpose
3. **Iterate** - first attempt is starting point, not final version
4. **Use examples** - "write similar text to this..."

### Workflow Optimization
1. **Open relevant files** before AI chat
2. **Batching** - process similar tasks together
3. **Templates** - create templates for recurring tasks
4. **Always review** - AI output isn't final version

### Common Mistakes
- ❌ Too vague instructions
- ❌ Not reviewing AI outputs
- ❌ Using wrong model for task
- ❌ Forgetting brand voice/tone
